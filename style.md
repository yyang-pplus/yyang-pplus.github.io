# Guidelines

All the posts on this site shall use the following conventions:

* Titles of posts and pages shall use **title-style capitalization**. Headings shall use **sentence-style capitalization**. In **sentence-style capitalization**, you capitalize only the first word of the title or heading, plus any proper nouns, proper adjectives, and terms that are always capitalized. If the title includes a colon, capitalize the first word that follows the colon, regardless of its part of speech.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references)

* Topics of interest or vocabulary terms shall be written in **bold**.
* An abbreviation shall be spelled out on the first use and the abbreviation in parentheses shall follow the spelled-out term; for example, **access control list (ACL)**.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references)
* An example email address shall use **example.com** in bold.
* To represent an unspecified or generic number, use _n_ as the variable and apply italics.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references)
* To represent an unspecified or unknown version number, use _x_ for each digit and apply italics.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#references)

* Names of utilities, commands, and things normally found in code shall be written as `inline code`.
* When showing input together with output, in order to differentiate input from output, a command prompt shall be included before input commands. In particular, The `$` symbol indicates a command should be run as regular users, while the `#` symbol means a command should be run as superusers. When showing input alone, the command prompt can be omitted.
* Code examples shall be minimum and representative. Especially, unnecessary keywords (`inline`, `nodiscard`, `noexcept`, etc.) shall be avoided as much as possible.

* Each quotation shall be followed by a number in square brackets written as superscription with a link to the numbered item of the references section at the end of the document. The page number or section number where the cited thing is discussed in the source document can also be specified in the square brackets, if applicable.
