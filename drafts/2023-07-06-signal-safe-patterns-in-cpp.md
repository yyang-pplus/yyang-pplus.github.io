In [my previous post]({{page.previous.url}}), we have discussed about signal handing in C++ briefly. In today's post, I'd like to dive deeper into the topic, and focus our discussion more on signal-safety.

# Signal Handling

* what is signal?

* what are signal used for? when to use signal?

* what signal are not used for? when to avoid signal?

* how to handle a signal

* how signal handing really works

* when to handle a signal

* when not to handle a signal


# what is signal-safety

# why you should care about signal-safety

# how to make sure a function is signal safe

# signal-safety patterns
